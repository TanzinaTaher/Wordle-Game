'Wordle' is a popular game where players must guess a word predetermined by the game developer. Each player is allowed up to five guesses. For every guess, players receive hints: if a guessed letter is correct but in the wrong position, it turns yellow; if it's correct and in the right position, it turns green; and for incorrect guesses, it turns grey. The game is developed in 3D using WebGL and JavaScript.
